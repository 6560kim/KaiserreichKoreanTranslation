PRU_intervene_decisevely:0 "결정적 개입"
PRU_intervene_decisevely_desc:0 "경제는 저절로 치유되지 않을 것이라는 사실 하나는 확실합니다. 페루의 안정을 위해선 개입주의 정책이 필요합니다."

PRU_industrial_renewal_desc:0 "낡은 우리나라의 산업은 검은 월요일을 견뎌내려 고군분투하고 있으며, 산업 생산성이 크게 하락하고 있습니다. 우리 산업이 번창하려면 정부의 개입이 필요합니다."
PRU_import_substituition_effort:0 "보조금 지원"
PRU_import_substituition_effort_desc:0 "우리는 소비재 생산에 집중할 것이고, 구리와 같은 원자재로 대가를 지불할 것입니다. 이는 위험하기는 하지만 장기적으로 성과를 거둘 것입니다."
PRU_industrial_effort:0 "건설업 집중"
PRU_industrial_effort_desc:0 "아직 걸음마 단계인 우리 건설업은 검은 월요일에 의해 몰락했습니다. 우리는 건설업을 지켜내야 합니다!"
PRU_consumer_goods_manufactories:0 "소비재 공장들"
PRU_consumer_goods_manufactories_desc:0 "경제위기로 인해 가장 피해를 많이 보는 사람들은 일반인들입니다. 그들의 기본 욕구가 충족되지 못하면, 그들은 게을러지고, 분노하고, 불순한 국제주의에 빠지게 될 것입니다. 우리는 이를 막아야 합니다."
PRU_military_industrial_complex:0 "군수산업단지"
PRU_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "우리 나라의 군사 산업 단지는 아주 엉망이고, 구식 장비를 생산하고 있습니다. 우리의 주권을 지키려면 상황을 개선시켜야 합니다."

PRU_rubber_boom_desc:0 "유럽에 피할 수 없는 전쟁이 다가오고 있고 타이어와 다른 군수품에 대한 수요가 급증함에 따라 고무의 가치는 높아질 것입니다. 우리는 그 이윤을 활용해야 합니다."
PRU_aluminium:0 "알루미늄 광산 확장"
PRU_aluminium_desc:0 "Our mines of aluminium are simply too small to support our heavy industries, especially the ones we have planned ahead for the future. We must ensure that Peru is tapping its mineral potential to its fullest capacity."

# Expansion #
PRU_summit:0 "연합 만세!"
PRU_summit_desc:0 "The Peru-Bolivian confederation was short lived when it was first founded in 1837. Neighbouring nations saw us a threat and forced us to separate us from our Bolivian brothers. A long time has passed since those events, yet we've never forgotten the bond that once kept us together. Today, we have decided that the time is right to finally unite again with our brothers!"
PRU_customs_union:0 "함께 앞으로 가자"
PRU_customs_union_desc:0 "We have always been close to our Bolivian brothers. We were both colonies of Spain, we both were freed by the same heroes and we both have stood side by side many times in our history. Provided this, we can safely say that as long as we stand shoulder to shoulder in union, we will be able to face any foe, no matter how mighty, and solve any problem, no matter how daunting it might be."
PRU_treaty_of_frienship:0 "진정으로 평등한 연합"
PRU_treaty_of_frienship_desc:0 "Other 'Confederations' in the world, like the Austro-Hungarian Empire, speak a lot of equality in theory yet very little of it is actually seen in practice. We don't want to be like them, and as such we will guarantee that every citizen within the Peru-Bolivian Confederation will have the same rights and responsabilities, independently of wether they were born in either of those now defunct countries."
PRU_propose_union:0 "국가 통합"
PRU_propose_union_desc:0 "Creating a confederation is no small task. The previous aparatus of state that Peru and Bolivia had have to be adjusted, coordinated and refounded in order to not only ressemble the old institutions they once had, but to improve upon them and create an even better society."
PRU_liberate_bolivia:0 "볼리비아 해방"
PRU_liberate_bolivia_desc:0 "Bolivia's government has very obviously lost their way, and a group of concerned citizens have formed a government-in-exile in Lima and are lobbying for a military intervention! Given how unstable the country is, the international community and our neighbours would not be alarmed by such act of agression."
PRU_enforce_union:0 "Enforce Union"
PRU_enforce_union_desc:0 "Now that our negotiations are done, the Union of Peru and Bolivia will begin anew as soon as Peruvian arms liberate the country from the Syndicalist puppets that currently control it"
PRU_pooled_officer_corps:0 "합동 장교단"
PRU_pooled_officer_corps_desc:0 "Bolivia and Peru have many war veterans, with different experiences and views on warfare. If we were to pool our officer corps, we could achieve better results in battle drawing from their experience."
PRU_federated_admin_focus:0 "통합된 산업"
PRU_federated_admin_focus_desc:0 "With the Andean Common Market in full swing, we can now start to work with a true Peru-Bolivian economy, and adapt state incentives and tariffs accordingly."
PRU_united_army:0 "Army of the Union"
PRU_united_army_desc:0 "The Union had until now two separate army branches; merging them is necessary to ensure our safety, and that of our Bolivian brothers. Such an act will not be poorly seen, since for the common soldier of Bolivia, their officers and structure were synonymous with incompetence."
PRU_united_in_porpouse:0 "Scientific Exchange Program"
PRU_united_in_porpouse_desc:0 "The biggest universities of Peru and Bolivia have already started to work together, and perhaps the same principle could be applied to more... practical concerns of the Union."
PRU_fedrated_admin2:0 "Federated Administration"
PRU_fedrated_admin2_desc:0 "The administration of our Confederation is, essentially, non existent as of now. Let us establish a Confederation Cabinet in Lima, with representatives from both parts of our Union."
PRU_fornalize_the_union_constituiton:0 "Formalise the Union Constitution"
PRU_fornalize_the_union_constituiton_desc:0 "Our confederation has somewhat flimsy legal institutions at a national level, but that should be changed if we are to convert it into a modern nation state."
PRU_claims_of_the_confederation:0 "Claims of the Confederation"
PRU_claims_of_the_confederation_desc:0 "We must reinforce that we are a successor state to Bolivia, and thus we lay claim to all former Bolivian territory, even those parts we do not occupy."
PRU_claims_on_the_amazon:0 "아마존의 영유권"
PRU_claims_on_the_amazon_desc:0 "According to the Treaty of Madrid, the Amazon belonged to the Viceroyalty of Peru. Brazilian land thieves and Colombian brigands have for too long stood in the way of our rightful lands!"
PRU_get_that_horse_back:0 "Recover Acre"
PRU_get_that_horse_back_desc:0 "Through admittedly clever diplomatic maneuvering, Brazil stole Acre from Bolivia in the turn of the century. However, this will not stand, Acre and the rubber it contains are integral parts of the Confederation."
PRU_antofogasta:0 "Reclaim Arica and Antofogasta"
PRU_antofogasta_desc:0 "Chile stole so much from Peru when we were defeated in the War of the Pacific. We fought them together and lost, but now, the time has come to reclaim what is ours, peacefully... or otherwise"
PRU_el_chaco:0 "차코 영유권 주장"
PRU_el_chaco_desc:0 "The Chaco, where this whole mess began. The Argentinain dogs, backed by their Paraguayan lackeys, stole so much land that is Bolivian since colonial times, it's an terrible outrage! But such mistakes can be fixed, and no enemy can stand the combined might of our Nations!"
PRU_pastanza:0 "Demand Paztanza"
PRU_pastanza_desc:0 "Paztanza is by all accounts part of the viceroyalty of Peru, and is under illegal Ecuadorian occupation. Since works will not each them, we must continue diplomacy by other means."
PRU_press_border_claims:0 "Press our Border Claims"
PRU_press_border_claims_desc:0 "Peru's natural borders must be restored, and we will use our newly modernised army to make sure that ambition becomes a reality."

## Military ##
PRU_foreign_know_how:0 "외국인의 노하우"
PRU_foreign_know_how_desc:0 "Our military is indeed more well trained than those of our neighbours. However, that doesn't mean there is no room for improvement, especially with so many war veterans offering their services to us in past few years."
PRU_modern_military:0 "현대적인 군대"
PRU_modern_military_desc:0 "Peru's military is indeed capable of crushing that of all our neighbours; but that doesn't mean that it's modern in any way. A modernization program for our military structure may be risky, but the rewards would far outweight said risks."

# Army #
PRU_general_staff:0 "장군참모 재조직"
PRU_general_staff_desc:0 "Our General staff, victorious in border clashed with Colombia and in keeping our nation safe, is old and still clings to outdated ideas of war. They might be products of the past century, but we are about to prove that old dogs do learn new tricks."
PRU_army_logistics:0 "Logistics and Army Communications"
PRU_army_logistics_desc:0 "A modern army must be flexible and use new technologies and innovations. Chief among those for military use is the Radio, but also computers to cipher our communications, and Radars to watch the skies above and keep our boys on the ground safe."
PRU_equipment_effort:0 "Re-Arm our Regiments"
PRU_equipment_effort_desc:0 "Despite our élan and tactical skill, our boots on the ground still have fairly outdated equipment. In fact, for many, even their own clothes are either old or rentals! We must make sure our army is refitted to a higher standard of quality."
PRU_support_effort:0 "Support Battalion Drills"
PRU_support_effort_desc:0 "Gone by are the days where sheer numbers would win wars. Now, even the smallest specialist brigade can mean the difference between a resounding victory and an utter defeat."
PRU_tank_effort:0 "Tank Experiments"
PRU_tank_effort_desc:0 "Tanks are a still somewhat new invention, and some still doubt their true potential. We do have some officers who don't, and they request our support to make sure our armoured corps are a well oiled machine of conquest!"
PRU_extensive_bellic_incentvies:0 "Militarist Lobbying"
PRU_extensive_bellic_incentvies_desc:0 "Our industrialist are now actively lobbying the government for a bigger defence funding budget. Perhaps, if we were to listen to their proposals, we could get better deals and ensure our forces are well supplied."
PRU_production_effort:0 "생산 집중"
PRU_production_effort_desc:0 "With their interests defended, our nation's military and industrialists now can fully realise the potential of their alliance and make sure our army never runs out of fresh supplies."
PRU_hegemon_of_the_andes:0 "안데스 헤게모니"
PRU_hegemon_of_the_andes_desc:0 "Our army truly dwarfs that of our neighbours, and we know it. They know it. Everybody knows it."
PRU_mountain_training:0 "산악여단"
PRU_mountain_training_desc:0 "It's not difficult to train mountaineers in Peru, the mighty Andes mountains are the defining feature of our geography! We must, however, ensure that their training is in par with those of the Great Powers, to ensure our safety."
PRU_airland_training:0 "공수훈련"
PRU_airland_training_desc:0 "It's one thing to teach a man how to use a parachute. It's another entirely to do so to thousands of men, and make sure that they are always combat ready after landing!"
PRU_coastal_operations:0 "연안작전"
PRU_coastal_operations_desc:0 "The nature of the Pacific coast of South America makes conventional invasions a difficult matter, especially in Chile. Perhaps a better option would be to use our control of the seas and enact amphibious invasions of strategic points along the coastline."
PRU_an_army_of_movement:0 "An Army of Movement"
PRU_an_army_of_movement_desc:0 "Some military experts say that Modern War is going to be about fast encircling actions and mechanised pincers, and full integration between land and air forces. The officers who support this notion have asked us to officially support their plans to revise our strategic and tactical directives."
PRU_mechanization_moblity:0 "Mechanisation & Mobility"
PRU_mechanization_moblity_desc:0 "A key aspect of the doctrine we will adopt will be the fast moving forces that will ensure our victory. And no, we can't use horses, so we'll need a fully mechanised, combat ready infantry force."
PRU_fast_and_furious:0 "속공"
PRU_fast_and_furious_desc:0 "Our armies will strike in quick and decisive fashion; forced march drills and driving shift training are now among the standard army exercises. Only by outmaneuvering our foes we can truly ensure victory."
PRU_localized_pushes:0 "Localised Pushes"
PRU_localized_pushes_desc:0 "A key aspect to modern war are encirclements. Such encirclements are done by surrounding an enemy force with small forces, or pincers, while the main army prevents them from reatreating. We must be sure our capacity to actually capitalise on openings and to perform armoured spearheads is indeed as good it could possibly be."
PRU_operational_integrity:0 "Operational Integrity"
PRU_operational_integrity_desc:0 "Some military experts say that Modern War is going to be about grand encircling actions on a strategic level, and careful logistics planning. The officers who support this notion have asked us to officially support their plans to revise our strategic and tactical directives"
PRU_battleline_planning:0 "유동적인 전선계획"
PRU_battleline_planning_desc:0 "No battleplan survives contact with the enemy, and flexibility and adaptability will be key if our offensives are to succeed."
PRU_general_offensive_planning:0 "공세계획 집중"
PRU_general_offensive_planning_desc:0 "A good plan is a plan that takes into accounts all factors, including the less obvious ones. Making sure our officers know battleplans are a complex matter that must be carefully studied will take effort, but will improve our army's combat efficiency."
PRU_stop_enemy_pincers:0 "Stop Enemy Pincers"
PRU_stop_enemy_pincers_desc:0 "Although tanks are not as common sight in South America, that fact only makes it more likely that enemy spearheads will be armoured, since they will spare no effort for their success. Thus, we must be prepared with state of the art Anti Tank equipment."
PRU_apply_lessons:0 "군대 정예화 교리"
PRU_apply_lessons_desc:0 "Our officers now fully grasp the goals and methods we have laid out for our military. We are more than ready for war, if it comes."

# Navy #
PRU_high_admiralty:0 "Peruvian High Admiralty"
PRU_high_admiralty_desc:0 "Our navy has it's issues, but it's a source of pride no doubt. If we are to keep our largest cities safe, we must control the seas, and our High Admirals request government intervention to improve the situation of the Peruvian navy."
PRU_destroyers:0 "잠수함 킬러"
PRU_destroyers_desc:0 "Small, fast ships will ensure that our civilian and capital ships are safe from cowardly U-Boat offensives."
PRU_cruiser:0 "순양함 재개장"
PRU_cruiser_desc:0 "Our cruisers are, well, pretty much museum pieces. Not much can be done to sugarcoat how vastly outdated these ships are. A renewal is sorely needed."
PRU_fleet_renewal:0 "조선소 재개장"

PRU_bb:0 "주력함 집중"
PRU_bb_desc:0 "While cruisers are more than sufficient for our coast guard needs, if we are to win a war against a significant power such as Chile or La Plata, we must have a true flagship, one that will smash our enemies and inspire awe in our sailors."

# Air #
PRU_air:0 "안데스 창공"
PRU_air_desc:0 "Flying between high mountains and strong wind currents is no mean feat, and our pilots are rightfully proud of their skills. But our planes are old, and our tactics, outdated"
PRU_fighter:0 "새 전투기 모델"
PRU_fighter_desc:0 "Keeping control of the skies will be fundamental for war to be successfully waged in the future. Our command over the skies of the Andes is currently absolute, but for how long if we become complacent?"
PRU_bomber:0 "새 폭격기 모델"
PRU_bomber_desc:0 "Making sure we can take the fight to our enemy is the charge of our Bomber Squads, but they request newer models that can unleash larger payloads and move faster."
PRU_CAS:0 "급강하 폭격기 훈련"
PRU_CAS_desc:0 "Close air support bombing is dangerous business, and without proper training it can take both the pilot and the aircraft from us"
PRU_air_drills:0 "Aerial Drills"
PRU_air_drills_desc:0 "Practice makes perfect, and our air force is nearing that point with constant drills and combat exercises. We will rule the skies!"

PRU_dealing_with_chaos_desc:0 "The assassination of the president; the chaos in the government, the Leguia regime, the war with Colombia. So much has happened in the last few years, and many worry for the future of Peru. We must now focus on restoring stability, law and order back to our country."
PRU_extend_ARPA_ban:0 "Extend the APRA Ban"
PRU_extend_ARPA_ban_desc:0 "The APRA was supposed to be a moderate option for those of left leaning views in Peru; however, they shamed themselves and the nation with the vile assassination of Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro, our president, in 1933. We could extend the terms of the APRA ban and purge it of it's most radical leaders, while extending an olive branch to party members whose loyalties lie with Peru, and not the Internationale."
PRU_deal_with_internationalists:0 "Clamp down on APRA"

PRU_help_workers:0 "노동계층을 돕다"
PRU_help_workers_desc:0 "The working classes have greatly suffered under the political chaos and the continuing economic depression. If we wish to avoid a syndicalist revolution, we should help the workers before the syndicalists promise them anything."
PRU_lima_expansion:0 "리마 산업 확충"
PRU_lima_expansion_desc:0 "Lima is the cultural, political, and economic center of Peru. We should increase our funding for the local industrial development projects so that the heart of our nation continues to beat on."
PRU_weather_the_storm:0 "Weather the Storm"

pru.1.d:0 "페루는 1821년부터 사실상 독립상태였지만 스페인 정부는 1871년 친차제도를 둘러싼 충돌로 인해 양국간 평화상태가 깨진 이후에야 식민지의 자치권을 인정했습니다. 이후 페루는 볼리비아와 동맹을 맺은 이유로 1879년부터 1883년까지 이어진 아타카마 사막에서 벌어진 볼리비아와 칠레간 국경분쟁에 참전했습니다. 이 전쟁으로 페루는 타라파카, 아리카, 타크나 지역을 잃었습니다. 때를 틈타 영국과 미국의 자본가들이 페루의 채무를 없애주는 조건으로 약화된 페루 국영 철도를 가져갔습니다. 세계대전 이후, 1919년 아우구스토 레기아의 쿠데타가 페루의 민주주의를 공격했습니다. 1924년 멕시코에서 아메리카 혁명인민동맹이 결성되었을 때쯤, 레기아 정권은 1925년 월 스트리트 대폭락이라는 거대한 위협에 직면했습니다. 11개월동안 계속된 개혁에도 불구하고 문제는 해결되지 않았고 APRA의 지원을 받은 노동자들의 폭동이 일어나기 시작했습니다. 폭동이 사회주의 혁명으로 연결될 것을 우려한 군대가 사태에 개입하였고, 루이스 산체스 세로 중령이 레기아 정권을 전복시켰습니다. 4개월 후 레기아는 페루 국가에 대한 각종 범죄 혐의로 유죄 판결을 받아 사형당했습니다. 처음에는 세로 정권의 지지율이 낮았으나, 1929년에서 1930년 사이에 있던 사건으로 인해 인기가 크게 올랐습니다. 폭동을 진압하고 콜롬비아와의 전쟁에서 승리했기 때문입니다. 슬프게도 얼마 지나지 않아 연설을 하던 세로를 한 폭도가 총으로 쏘아 죽였습니다. 동시에 그가 이끌던 혁명연맹이 혼란에 빠졌고 온건파였던 오스카 베나비데스가 페루 안정을 위해 연합 정부를 구성하기 시작했습니다. 혁명연맹이 재기를 준비하는 한편, 민주 정당이 끊임없이 선거 로비를 벌이고 APRA 세력이 기회를 노리고 있습니다. 페루에 어떤 일이 벌어지게 될까요?"
pru.1.a:0 "어떤 미래가 다가오든, 우리는 준비되어 있다"
pru.8.t:0 "페루가 안토파가스타를 요구하다"
pru.8.d:0 "페루가 안토파가스타와 아리카를 할양하지 않는다면 전쟁을 선포할 거라고 위협했습니다!"
pru.8.a:0 "선택지가 없군... 영토를 할양해라"
pru.8.b:0 "원한다면, 가져가 보시지!"
pru.10.t:0 "베를린 경제위기가 안데스를 강타하다"
pru.10.d:0 "베를린발 경제위기가 걷잡을 수 없이 눈덩이처럼 불어나면서 수출에 기대고 있는 우리나라 경제가 파산 직전에 놓여있습니다! 미래는 암울하고 불확실하며, 페루 투자자들의 투자금이 사라지고 있습니다. 일부는 쉬운 탈출구를 선택하기도 합니다."
pru.10.a:0 "디오스 미오(세상에)!"
pru.17.t:0 "안토파가스타 할양"
pru.17.d:0 "사악한 침략자들이 안토파가스타에서 물러났습니다"
pru.17.a:0 "많은 생명이 목숨을 부지했구나!"
pru.18.t:0 "요구가 거부당하다"
pru.18.d:0 "전쟁입니다! 침략자들은 안토파가스타 점령을 포기하라는 요구를 거부했습니다"
pru.18.a:0 "조만간 자기들이 어떤 실수를 저질렀는지 뼈저리게 느끼게 해주지!"
pru.19.t:0 "연방 공식화"
pru.19.d:0 "우리 군대가 볼리비아 영토를 점거하고 있으므로 오래 전에 없어진 연방 부활을 막을 수 있는 세력은 아무도 없습니다!"
pru.19.a:0 "견고한 연방 만세!"

pru.30.t:0 "에콰도르와의 평화?"
pru.30.d:0 "The war with Ecuador has been a spectacular failure. They still control most, if not all, of their territory, while also starting to occupy Peruvian land. Many of our generals have come to us, begging us to sue for peace with the Ecuadorian government. Some of our spies in their government have even warned us that this may be the only chance we have to gain peace, for as the Ecuadorian military achieves victory after victory, their government grows bold, and will be less willing to accept peace with our government at all. Perhaps it is time to end the death."
pru.30.a:0 "평화가 필요하다."
pru.30.b:0 "우린 끝까지 싸울 것이다!"
pru.31.t:0 "페루가 평화를 제안하다"
pru.31.d:0 "We have recently recieved an offer for peace from the Peruvian government. Evidently, they have been scared by our military might, and have been forced to try to end the bloodshed. Of course, we have no claims on Peruvian land, so there is little reason to continue the war."
pru.31.a:0 "받아들이자."
pru.31.b:0 "완전한 승리가 머지 않았다!"
pru.102.t:0 "아프라주의자의 폭탄 테러"
pru.102.d:0 "The rampant Aprist militias have bombed another privately owned factory. Will these scoundrels never stop?"
pru.102.a:0 "망할!"
pru.103.t:0 "에콰도르의 운명"
pru.103.d:0 "The tensions between us and Ecuador have reached a boiling point. We have tolerated the puny Ecuadorians long enough!"
pru.103.a:0 "그럼 전쟁이다!"
pru.104.t:0 "An Attempt on Larreas Life!"
pru.104.d:0 "During [getpru104], our dear leader Larrea has been shot at by an Aprist assassin. Luckily, he was not hurt and the perpetrator has been shot dead. However, this shows our governments growing weakness. Should we start preparing for elections and let the people decide their fate?"
pru_104_d1:0 "the usual rounding of the troops"
pru_104_d2:0 "a military parade comemorating the war"
pru.104.a:0 "It's time to retire, let's prepare for elections"
pru.104.b:0 "Never! We will be even harsher to quell all opposing voices!"
pru.105.t:0 "선거"
pru.105.d:0 "After all this time, elections have finally started in Peru! The liberal Movimiento Democrático, the conservative Nuevo Pacto Civilista, the social democrat Partido Socialdemócrata and the rabidly nationalist Union Revolucionaria have all participated, but who shall be victorious? While the liberals, conservatives and social democrats promise a continued democracy, the Union Revolutionaria promises to stop elections and allocate even more resources to hunt down and exterminate APRA."
pru.105.a:0 "Nuevo Pacto Civilista"
pru.105.b:0 "Movimiento Democrático"
pru.105.c:0 "Partido Socialdemócrata"
pru.105.e:0 "Union Revolucionaria"
pru.106.t:0 "Aprist Revolution!"
pru.106.d:0 "After the current government intensified their socialist reprisals, a last resort plan was hatched by the Aprists. A desperate march to the capitals with all the remaining militias would try to topple the government, ushering in a new era for the workers."
pru.106.a:0 "The revolution is crushed by the army!"
pru.106.b:0 "The revolution miraculously wins!"
pru.107.t:0 "사회주의자들의 투쟁"
pru.107.d:0 "After the revolution, the Aprists started crumbling, with the Tupacamarists trying to take power in the country by themselves. A fierce struggle started between the remaining Apra and the Tupacamarists."
pru.107.a:0 "El APRA nunca muere!"
pru.107.b:0 "Tupacamarists win. Viva el Piruw!"
pru.108.t:0 "Elections in Peru"
pru.108.d:0 "The second round of elections since Larrea stepped down have begun! Who would win this time? While the liberals, conservatives and social democrats promise a continued democracy, the Union Revolutionaria promises to stop elections and allocate even more resources to hunt down and exterminate APRA."
pru.108.a:0 "Nuevo Pacto Civilista"
pru.108.b:0 "Movimiento Democrático"
pru.108.c:0 "Partido Socialdemócrata"
pru.108.e:0 "Union Revolucionaria"
pru.109.t:0 "Aguero is Dead!"
pru.109.d:0 "Aguero had a stroke this morning. The whole country mourns him, but the upper echelons of the party had no clear successor."
pru.109.a:0 "What will happen to Peru?"
pru.110.t:0 "A Leader for Peru"
pru.110.d:0 "The time has come for the strongmen of the party to settle on which one of them will end up as the new Caudillo."
pru.110.a:0 "Caudillo Miró-Quesada!"
pru.110.b:0 "Caudillo Flores!"
pru.110.c:0 "Caudillo Ureta!"
pru.111.t:0 "Odria Coups!"
pru.111.d:0 "Due to the indecisiveness of the Union Revolucionaria, Manuel Odria has used this chance to topple the government to bring the country back to its senses!"
pru.111.a:0 "The disaster is over!"
pru.112.t:0 "The Quecha Revolt!"
pru.112.d:0 "Because of our latest policies set on proving the superiority of the Hispanics, the people inhabiting this land before Columbus have risen up to challenge our laws!"
pru.112.a:0 "Let's put them down!"
pru.113.t:0 "Incursions in Ecuador"
pru.113.d:0 "Let us start doing military exercises on the border with Ecuador, with some of our units 'wrongfully' crossing the border, to provoke them. We shall prepare for a war to subjugate Eduador!"
pru.113.a:0 "To war, Peruvians!"
pru.114.t:0 "Fiestas Patrias"
pru.114.d:0 "Our national holidays celebrating our independence and armed forces have begun! General José de San Martín, known as Peru's liberator, proclaimed Peru's independence on the 28th of July 1821, freeing Peru from the Spanish oppression. People all over the country are enjoying their holidays, and parades are being organised in all major cities."
pru.114.a:0 "Viva el Perú!"
pru.115.t:0 "Benavides has died"
pru.115.d:0 "[getpru115]"
pru.115.a:0 "An era has ended."
pru_115_d1:0 "Our great Caudillo Oscar Benavides Larrea has died of natural causes. The whole nation mourns him, while his successor, the more radical and very racist Manuel Odria, takes his place to lead us into the future."
pru_115_d2:0 "One of our previous opressors, Oscar Benavides Larrea, has died of natural causes. While he was an enemy of the revolution and committed many atrocities against Peruvian socialists, some still mourn the man that ruled this country for many years. The man that took control of his scattered clique is Manuel Odria, a most despicable man whose racism cannot be understated."
pru_115_d3:0 "Oscar Benavides Larrea has died due to natural causes. Even though he was not Peru's best leader, he was able to keep the nation stable while also restoring elections, which indirectly lead to our ascension to power. His direct successor, Manuel Odria, is ideologically radical and bears a grudge against the native people."

pru.116.t:0 "루이스 마우리시오의 죽음"
pru.116.d:0 "Today during a skirmish in Barrios Altos between urristas and aprists, a young urrista by the name of Luis Mauricio was killed by a bullet. He was the son of an old family of oligarchs. To revenge him, his fellow urristas killed the aprist militants. This case shocked the Liman society, and the urristas in the congress proposed a public funeral for Mauricio. Our staff suggests to avoid the public funeral to not anger the common man, but that might alienate Riva Agüero..."
pru.116.a:0 "대중 장례식을 허가하자."
pru.116.b:0 "Let them hold an inner ceremony in their party"
pru.117.t:0 "La Piedra Cansada"
pru.117.d:0 "Today, our inteligence agency informed us about the publishing of a book by a Peruvian author exiled in Chile, Cesar Vallejo. The novel consists of a drama set during the colonial times about two indigenous miners and how they're exploited by the church and the colonial administration. The novel has strong criticism against aristocracy and religion. While the book is banned, it has managed to infiltrate the populace through illegal distribution."
pru.117.a:0 "A small piece of propaganda won't affect us!"

pru.1000.t:0 "페루 혁명"
pru.1000.d:0 "Peru has fallen to revolution fallowing the Caudillo winning the election, and is now willing to join us in the liberation of the workers of the world. We really don't have many reasons to deny their entry as it could work as a start to revolution in South America, but denying their entry is always an option."
pru.1000.a:0 "그들을 받아주자."
pru.1000.b:0 "거절하자."

pru.1001.t:0 "Into the Internationale"
pru.1001.d:0 "The Commune of France has accepted us into the Internationale, expecting us to uphold the revolution within South America. Together, we shall liberate the workers of the world."

pru.1002.d:0 "For reasons we do not know, the Commune of France has denied our entry into the Internationale. We'll have to hold out on our own within South America."
